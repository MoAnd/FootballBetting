# Football Betting Model
This is my implementation of a football betting algorithm. The algorithm is not done and is currently under work (whenever I get time/motivation), however, the parameter estimates via the likelihood function is completed. 

The main sources for the development of this implementation has been:
- Dixon, Mark J., and Stuart G. Coles. "Modelling association football scores and inefficiencies in the football betting market." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics) 46.2 (1997): 265-280.
